# frontend-interview-template

## Intro

The goal of this take home interview is to replicate the daily work you may be doing at Grace. It is not meant to take too much of your time, but please feel free to show off as much of your knowledge as possible.

## Things to keep in mind
- Please write the code as if it's a real contribution to a real product. As in, someone else may be coming in to add more features and make changes to your code.
- The most important thing is that it works - think of it as implementing an MVP. Minimal amount of styling is required to distinguish different components from each other, but spending a lot of time on the CSS would be the last priority. (We're roughly aiming for 6 hours max on this assignment.)
- You can use any packages (state manager, UI libraries, etc) and tooling you'd like. We have set up a basic template to get you started.

## When you're done
- Please open a PR describing what you've implemented, and anything we should be aware of. We'll review the work together in person, or over VTC.
